    <string name="info_title_model">Our Model</string>
    <string name="info_text_model">Is to bring an innovative approach to education through the advanced academic format which has students attending classes on campus two or three days a week with the follow through of prepared lesson plans by Sterling instructors at home on the alternate days. This allows the parent to be an integral part of the students education experience.</string>
